SD2IEC Pluggable
================

* KiCAD project files for my take on an [SD2IEC](http://www.pitsch.de/stuff/mmc2iec/) compatible board.
* The schematics are heavily based on the [design by Shadowolf](https://www.forum64.de/index.php?thread/21242-sd2iec-hardware-1-0/).
* There should probably more documentation here, but while it is still missing you may find some additional information in [this blog post](https://www.hackup.net/2017/12/sd2iec-revisited/).
